Jerry tried to give you tips (saying he is a seasoning expert), but you stuck to your \"famous bean chili recipe\" stubbornly.\n\nThe judges gave you quite the verbal thrashing when you served it to them. \"Oh, a famous chili. And I assume you think this is better than the meal options we gave you, huh? And who is it famous with anyway? I've never heard of it and I certainly wouldn't call it famous after tasting it.\n\nYou get fourth place, and are about to decide to never make your chili again, when Jerry tells you that he tried your chili and thought it was delicious. You two become lifelong friends and have a chili cookout every month."))

    options.append(TreeNode("Turns out it was a good choice to follow Jerry outside. He had been right around the corner the whole time, firing up the grill and smoking meats. Where he got the meats, or what type they are, he hasn't given you a clear answer on, although you thought you heard him mumbling somthing about squirrel and goat.\n\nYou weren't sure it would be a good mix, but the judges ended up absolutely loving it. Not only did they give you first place and the $1,000,000 prize, they also gave you and Jerry co-lead-chef positions at an up and coming restaurant in New York City. Congratulations!"))
    options.append(TreeNode("Oh no, you've made a huge mistake. Turns out Jerry had been grilling some delectable fresh meats outside. Jerry tried to carry his meat inside, but you made him so stressed out that he forgot to bring any plates or buckets outside with him. He grabbed the meat with his hands to try and carry it in, but with the meat fresh off the grill, it ended up being too hot for him, and he dropped all of it on the way in.\n\nWith no time left, you grabbed your brussel sprouts and threw them into the bucket, then served that to the judges. They laughed you out of the building when they saw that you gave them a meat bucket with no meat in it, and you ended up getting last place. Better luck next time!"))
    options.append(TreeNode("You go for the chicken, but Jerry is devastated. He has a pet chicken (one of those white ones with the mohawk shaped feathers on their heads) and feels a deep connection to them. He is appalled that you would even consider eating chicken.\n\nHe throws away all of his meats in protest and then throws your chicken in the trash. You now have nothing to serve the judges, and you get last place."))
    options.append(TreeNode("You went for the beef. Excellent choice. Jerry does end up coming back last minute with multiple barbequed meats - squirrel, rabbit, venison, and the like, but beef was not in his selection.\n\nYou toss it in the bucket and the judges rave about how the beef pulled everything together. They love the wide variety of meats and they talk about how much they hate it when people try to add a side dish to a meat bucket - \"why does a perfectly good bucket of meat need something else?\" they rant.\n\nThank goodness you didn't end up making a side! You end up getting 2nd place, with a $10,000 each prize."))

    options.append(TreeNode("You decide to serve the soup. As expected, it is not excellent with the ground tuna in it, but your combination of cheddar and gouda has so delighted the judges that they are willing to overlook the gross soup entirely. They still give you first place, and you win $1,000,000. Congratulations!"))
    options.append(TreeNode("You turn down the soup, and at first all seems well. The judges love the grilled cheese, and they give you first place, with you winning $1,000,000. You are overjoyed, and start walking toward your car outside.\n\nYou have forgotten, though, that you destroyed a man\'s dignity. All Jernigan wanted was one decision on his one day of fame, and you couldn't even give him that! First the grilled cheese, then the pepper jack, and now his soup! He is enraged. Jernigan follows you outside, and robs you of your portion of the winnings at gunpoint. He smashes your brand new car with a baseball bat, and tells you that he will have men watching you for the smallest mis-step for the rest of your life. There are no witnesses, and Jernigan disappears, never to be seen again. You live the rest of your life in fear."))

    options.append(TreeNode("You take the bet, and your gut feeling was right! The judges like your grilled cheese, but say the cheese leaves something to be desired.\n\nYou end up with 2nd place, so you get $10,000 in winnings from the show and $20,000 additional from the bet. Good call!"))
    options.append(TreeNode("You don't take the bet, and you end up getting 2nd place. The judges like the grilled cheese, but they feel the cheese leaves something to be desired.\n\nYou still win $10,000 for second place, but you could have gotten $20,000 more. Congratulations..?"))

    options.append(TreeNode("You decided to wait for Jernigan, and he did make it back in time! His idea was to serve the frog legs on skewers in small fancy cups.Now your frog legs look very gourmet!\n\nThe judges don't think anything of the small amount of food since it looks so fancy, and you get 1st place, winning $1,000,000. Congratulations!"))
    options.append(TreeNode("You decided not to wait for Jernigan, and you serve all the frog legs in the one big bucket you have.\n\nThe judges immediately ask why there are so few frog legs in such a big bucket, and you are forced to tell them that you didn't get enough.They are disappointed in your lack of preparation, and you end up with 3rd place (out of 4). You get no prize money. Better luck next time!"))

    options.append(TreeNode("You think the judges are looking at it favorably, and so you decide to speak up. \"Me and Jernigan helped come up with the idea together!,\" you make sure to point out.\n\nUnfortunately, you must have misread the judges. They berate both of you for your disgusting idea of serving whole frogs. \"I don't want my food to be looking at me!,\" they exclaim, and throw your meal away without even trying it.\n\nYou get last place and are talked badly about in the cooking community for years."))
    options.append(TreeNode("You decide that you aren't so sure you want to associate your name with the frog idea. They tell off Jernigan for serving the whole frogs, saying that they hate the idea, but they taste just the legs and decide they really like the seasoning.\n\nYou get 3rd place, and a fancy restaurant owner who saw you on the show offers you a job as chef at his new restaurant. No wins, but not a terrible outcome overall!"))

    options.append(TreeNode("You forego naming the basket, and the judges like it quite a bit, but are a little disappointed that it has no name. They feel it needed a zesty gourmet name for a fancy entrance. They give you 2nd place and you win $10,000."))
    options.append(TreeNode("You decide to go with the Mystery Meat Bucket name. The judges think the meat is delicious, and they don't ask any questions about meat type. Suprisingly, they like the surprise that Mystery Meat Bucket provides.\n\nThey give you first place, and you are about to walk away with $1,000,000, when Jernigan announces that he remembers what the meat type label in the pantry said. The meat type is Tiger!\n\nHe announces this discovery on live television, and the cops show up on poaching charges and shut the show down. You do not end up with any winnings."))

    options.append(TreeNode("You serve the meat bucket with chocolate chip cookies, and the judges couldn't be happier with the combination. They congratulate you on your excellent making of a delicious classic, saying they are the best chocolate chip cookies they've ever had.\n\nThey are so excited about the cookies that they don't even ask you what kind of meat you used in the bucket. They give you first place, and you win $1,000,000. Congratulations!"))
    options.append(TreeNode("You serve the meat bucket with white chocolate chip macadamia cranberry cookies, but the judges find the combination a bit odd.\n\"I would have loved it with just plain white chocolate macadamia cookies, or with chocolate chip, but these cranberries just make my mouth sad,\" one judge comments.\n\nYou end up with 2nd place and go home with $10,000."))
