            <p>My name is Nicole, and I am a Computer Science student at Colorado State University. I moved from Michigan to Colorado about a year ago, 
                and in my free time I have been exploring new places for hiking and biking in my new state. I also enjoy disc golfing, 
                strategy board games, pickleball, and learning new songs on the acoustic guitar.
            </p> 
            <p> I started teaching myself programming in mid-2020, beginning by learning Data Analysis with Python and Web Development with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Node.js. 
                I started officially pursuing my bachelor's degree in 2021, but I still love doing personal projects on the side to practice new skills. I thought building this website 
                would be a fun way to practice Web Development and display some of my projects as my programming skills grow.
